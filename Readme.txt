We use two algorithms to calculate the product of two matrices. One algorithm is the general iterative multiplication method and the other is the strassen method.
We use a header file which contains the two functions as well as the helping functions like sum and substract. It also contains a tet case function.
The main function first resizes the vector according the rows and columns so that it is a square matrix. Then it fills up the matrices with random values between MIN and MAX.
Test cases are defined, one for each function testing the results of multiplication of 2
